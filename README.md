i use this to easily download my costmetics on other fresh arch installs

this will be slowly worked on overtime into a full prebuilt setup script

2. cd bleezies-dotfiles
3. chmod +x setup.sh
4. ./setup.sh
5. input password for shell change
6. boom ur in

if anyone has any recommendations for additions or changes just let me know somehow
